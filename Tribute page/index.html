<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <p>Freddie Mercury, born as Farrokh Bulsara on 5th September 1946, was a British singer and songwriter who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist and pianist of the rock band Queen. He was known for his flamboyant stage persona and a powerful vocal range spanning four octaves.</p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/2f/7e/8f2f7e6dec2e3c8034627caa33314c06.jpg" style="height: 100px; margin-left: 20px;">

  <p>Born in Stone Town, Sultanate of Zanzibar, Mercury attended English boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor.</p>

  <p>Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "Killer Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Somebody to Love", "We Are the Champions", "Don't Stop Me Now" and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists.</p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/this-is-a-great-photo-of-the-band-v0-14mct5qsxojb1.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=82df7a463e15968df9c5afbd0cfc7b1d7d7658fe" style="height: 100px; margin-left: 20px;">
